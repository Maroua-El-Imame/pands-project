# This program is part of the programming and Scripting module project in ATU.
# This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris dataset
# Please refer to Readme file and Jupyter notebook for aditional information about Iris dataset research, analysis and visualization.

# 1. Download and place the Iris into the current repository:
                # https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris

# 2. Current file : analysis.py
    # This program outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
    # Saves a histogram of each variable to png files
    # Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
    # Performs any other analysis we think is appropriate.

# scope : 
    # Imagine we are giving a presentation on the Iris dataset where we explain what investigating a dataset entails and how Python can be used to do it.
