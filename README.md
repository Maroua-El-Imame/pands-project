## ðŸ”¹Problem Statement    
Analyzing the Iris dataset using Python.  
This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set.  
This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

## ðŸ”¹Task List  

Based on the project instructions, I enumerate the task list as follows :  
This list will be periodically updated upon the progression or completion of each step.


- [x]   Research the dataset online and write a summary about it in README. file.
- [x]   Download the data set and add it to your repository.
- [x]   Write a program called analysis.py
- [x]   analysis.py > outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
- [x]   analysis.py > saves a histogram of each variable to png files
- [ ]   analysis.py > outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
- [ ]   Perform any other analysis you think is appropriate.
- [ ]   in extra: a Jupyter notebook containing all necessary comments.**â€¢***"This notebook is intended to contain only self-written content, as well as code from external sources to include with proper referencing where appropriate*.

## ðŸ”¹ Task Breakdown

This section breaks this project into smaller manageable steps.  
It outlines the project in terms of initiation, research, analysis and visualization of the **Iris dataset using Python** .  
The project management approach I followed is ' the five phases of the project lifecycle '.

### ðŸ”¸Initiation phase :
---

This project aims to illustrate the practicality of using Python for data analysis.  
The topic of this project is : **Analyzing the Iris dataset using Python**. 

### ðŸ”¸Planning phase :
---

In this 2nd phase lists the steps to follow in order to achive the project results.

*   Setup : *< still need to extend this setup section <font color=#5D3FD3>**! ! ! !**</font>*   
In order to successfully run and understand the results of this project, it is essential to first set up the appropriate environment.   


Anaconda / VScode  
Cmder  
Make directories  
Link local folders to Github repositories  
Synchronize changes   
Additional files : .gitignore ; README.md   
  
### ðŸ”¸Executuion & Implementation phase :
---

Why IRIS dataset ?  

The Iris data set is often used in data analysis because itâ€™s small, simple, well-organized which makes it an easy dataset to work with.  
Itâ€™s great for learning how to explore data, identify patterns, and practice analysis and visualization.

3.2 Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

---  

 Download [**Iris data set**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)


3.3 Methods for processing the data: 

---

From the folder, read the 'iris.data' file in csv format through an identified file path  
View the dataframe  

ðŸ”¹Program dev progress :


Dataset variables are separated into columns  
Add columns names since the dataframe doesnt include any  
Group the dataset by columns (variables)  
Customise txt files names  
Save a summary of each variable to a single text file  
Save a histogram of each variable to png files 

3.4 Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:
