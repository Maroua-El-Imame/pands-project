## Problem Statement  

This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set.  
This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.   

*Additional Information of the Iris dataset* :  
*<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris>*

## Task List  
Following the project instructions, I established a task breakdown as follows:


- [ ]   Research the dataset online and write a summary about it in README. file.
- [ ]   Download the data set and add it to your repository.
- [ ]   Write a program called analysis.py
- [ ]   analysis.py > outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
- [ ]   analysis.py > saves a histogram of each variable to png files
- [ ]   analysis.py > outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
- [ ]   Perform any other analysis you think is appropriate  
- [ ]   in extra: a Jupyter notebook containing all necessary comments.**•***"This notebook is intended to contain only self-written content, as well as code from external sources to include with proper referencing where appropriate.*

## Task Breakdown

This section breaks this project into smaller manageable steps.  
It will outline the project in terms of collection, analysis and visualisation of the **Iris dataset**.
