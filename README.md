## Problem Statement    
Analyzing the Iris dataset using Python.  
This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set.  
This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

## Task List  
Based on the project instructions, I enumerate the task list as follows :  
This list will be periodically updated upon the progression or completion of each step.


- [x]   Research the dataset online and write a summary about it in README. file.
- [x]   Download the data set and add it to your repository.
- [x]   Write a program called analysis.py
- [x]   analysis.py > outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
- [ ]   analysis.py > saves a histogram of each variable to png files
- [ ]   analysis.py > outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
- [ ]   Perform any other analysis you think is appropriate.
- [ ]   in extra: a Jupyter notebook containing all necessary comments.**•***"This notebook is intended to contain only self-written content, as well as code from external sources to include with proper referencing where appropriate*.

## Task Breakdown

This section breaks this project into smaller manageable steps.  
It outlines the project in terms of initiation, research, analysis and visualization of the **Iris dataset using Python** .  
The project management approach I followed is ' the five phases of the project lifecycle '.

## Initiation phase :

This project aims to illustrate the practicality of using Python for data analysis.
The topic of this project is : **Analyzing the Iris dataset using Python**. 

## Planning phase :

In this 2nd phase, I list the steps to follow inn order to achive the project results.

*   Setup : *< still need to extend this setup section <font color=#5D3FD3>**! ! ! !**</font>*   
In order to successfully run and understand the results of this project, it is essential to first set up the appropriate environment. 

Anaconda / VScode  
Cmder  
Make directories  
Link local folders to Github repositories  
Synchronize changes   
Additional files : .gitignore ; README.md   
  
*   execution plan :
  
Please see Task list chapter.**(line 24)** (to update accoringly)  

## Executuion & Implementation phase :

<font color=#5D3FD>**2.Programming**</font>  
I created 2 files, with the following formats:    
 
  -*py format* : a regular python file that can be executed in a single run.  
    
  -*ipynb format* : interactive PYthon noteBook.  
   *' This notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects.'*  
-**Jupyter Team**, *[The Jupyter Notebook, Introduction](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#:~:text=by%20MathJax.-,Notebook%20documents,-%23)*.

### program progress

analysis.**ipynb** 

I implemented the first part, but I still need to finalize the remaining
File path identified  
Read the 'iris.data' file in csv format through the file path  
I need to read in a separate txt file each variable/feature of the iris dtaatset.
